# Software-for-simulating-the-behavior-of-ICVs-on-a-three-lane-highway-using-DQN
This software, based on the DQN model, is primarily designed to study the lane-changing decision mechanisms of ICVs. It provides a detailed simulation environment tailored to various real-world road conditions, including different traffic densities, numbers of ICVs, and specific ICV parameter settings.
